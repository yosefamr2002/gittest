                <dd>Born Arnold George Dorsey in Madras, India, on May 2, 1936, singer Engelbert Humperdinck scored
                    several hits during the 1960s. He is the second youngest of 10 children born to Mervyn and Olive
                    Dorsey; Humperdinck spent the first 11 years of his life in Madras, where his father worked as an
                    engineer. In 1947, the future crooner moved with his family to England, where they settled in
                    Leicester.

                    A self-described dreamer and loner, Humperdinck dropped out of school at the age of 15. After a
                    stint doing National Service in Germany, he began singing in men's clubs, but it was a hard way to
                    make a living. Singing under the name Gerry Dorsey, Humperdinck scraped by financially. His
                    financial pressures increased when he married his wife, Patricia. The couple eventually had four
                    children together.</dd>

                <dd>Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on May 5, 1988, in North London, England. Adele was the only child
                    of Penny Adkins, an "arty mom" who was just 18 at the time of her birth, and a Welsh father, Mark
                    Evans, who left the family when Adele was only four years old.Evans remained in contact with his
                    daughter up until her teen years, when his problems with alcohol and increasing estrangement from
                    his daughter caused their relationship to deteriorate. By contrast, Adele grew close to her mom, who
                    encouraged her young daughter "to explore, and not to stick with one thing.</dd>
